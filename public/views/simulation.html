  <h2>Simulation of Quantum Circuits using Decision Diagrams</h2>
  <p>
    In the following we briefly describe how to perform (classical) simulations
    of quantum circuits with the MQT DDVis tool. Note that a detailed
    description of the method itself (including links to the corresponding
    papers) is available at
    <a href="https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/research/quantum_simulation/"
      >our webpage on quantum circuit simulation</a
    >.
  </p>
  <h3>Loading a quantum circuit</h3>
  <p>An algorithm can be loaded in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Drag&Drop a circuit file in <i>.qasm</i> 2 or 3 format into the
      <b>Algorithm</b> box.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pick a pre-defined circuit file from the <b>Example Algorithms</b> list on
      the left.
    </li>
    <li>
      Start writing your own circuit description using either the
      <i>.qasm</i> 2 or 3 format. Templates for empty circuits are available in
      the <b>Example Algorithms</b> list.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Controlling the simulation</h3>
  <p>
    Once a valid circuit has been entered in the Algorithm box, the simulation
    can be controlled using the navigation buttons below it.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      →/←: Go one step forward or backward. Can be used to step through the
      simulation.
    </li>
    <li>
      ↠/↞: Go straight to the end (or the next special operation; see below) or
      back to the beginning.
    </li>
    <li>
      ▶/||: Start/Pause a diashow where the simulation advances step-by-step in
      an automated fashion.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Special Operations</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Barrier</b> statements (e.g., <i>barrier q;</i>) can be used as
    breakpoints when stepping forward with <b>↠</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Measurement</b> operations (e.g., <i>measure q[0] -> c[0];</i>) collapse
    the state of a qubit to one of its basis states. Whenever a qubit is about
    to get measured and it has a non-zero probability of being in either
    $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ (i.e., it is in superposition), a pop-up dialog
    appears which displays the probabilities for obtaining $\ket{0}$ and
    $\ket{1}$, respectively. Upon choosing one of the options, the decision
    diagram is irreversibly collapsed. Measurements also act as breakpoints due
    to their non-unitary (and, thus, non-reversible) nature. MQT DDVis supports
    <b>classically-controlled operations</b>, where a certain gate is only
    applied if some classical bits obtained from measurements are set.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Reset</b> operations discard a qubit and initialize it to $\ket{0}$ as if
    it were a new qubit. Mathematically this corresponds to taking the partial
    trace of the whole state and then setting the qubit to $\ket{0}$. However,
    the partial trace maps pure states to mixed states and can thus in general
    not be represented by the same kind of decision diagram used for
    representing state vectors. MQT DDVis supports resets in a probabilistic
    fashion (similar to measurements). Whenever a reset operation is encountered
    where the considered qubit has a non-zero probability of being in either
    $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$, a pop-up dialog appears which displays the
    probabilities for obtaining $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, respectively. Upon
    choosing one of the options, the other decision diagram branch is discarded
    and the remaining branch is set as the $\ket{0}$ branch. Resets also act as
    breakpoints due to their non-unitary (and, thus, non-reversible) nature.
  </p>
  <h3>Visualization Settings</h3>
  <p>
    The settings pane on the left side offers several options for changing the
    look and feel of the MQT DDVis tool.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Colored</b>: When ticked (default), the phase of edge weights in the
      decision diagram is color-coded according to the following HLS color
      wheel.<br />
      <img
        class="colorwheel"
        src="./assets/hls_colorwheel.svg"
        alt="HLS color wheel"
      /><br />
      When not ticked, edges whose weight is not equal to $1$ will be displayed
      dashed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Edge Labels</b>: When ticked, edge labels are explicitly annotated on
      the edges. Note that this frequently reduces the visual compactness of the
      visualization.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Classic</b>: This option allows to toggle a more classic decision
      diagram node style, which is more similar to the way decision diagrams are
      frequently visualized in research papers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Polar Coordinates</b>: This option allows switching between polar and
      rectangular coordinates for complex number visualization.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Step duration</b>: The minimum time for one transition when using the
      diashow feature. Note that the actual transition time might be longer in
      case of computationally expensive operations.
    </li>
  </ul>
